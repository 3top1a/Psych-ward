# Psychic Trial - Entry for [Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-7)

Stuff learned:
- **GAMEPLAY FUCKING FIRST**
- **UX SECOND**
- **GFX LAST**
- Do multiple fraction-in-a-second choices (shotgun vs rifle)
- Explain the mechanics
- No main menu was a good thing
- No settings was a bad thing
- Don't embed PCK's
- **Sign the fucking executable**
- There is a period after the end that lets you still upload, don't fucking rush

Anyway, enjoy.
